## Trupeer Introduction

Trupeer is a San Francisco-based AI platform that transforms rough screen recordings into professional product videos and step-by-step documentation in minutes. Founded by Shivali Goyal and Pritish Gupta, the company recently raised $3 million in seed funding led by RTP Global, with participation from Salesforce Ventures after winning the Salesforce AI Pitchfield in 2025.

The platform works with a simple workflow. You record your screen using their Chrome extension, capturing whatever you're demonstrating. Then Trupeer's AI engine takes over, automatically generating clean scripts, adding professional voiceovers in over 50 languages, inserting zoom effects, and even creating AI avatars if you want them. Within minutes, you have both a polished video and a structured document with screenshots and instructions.

What makes Trupeer different from basic screen recording tools is the AI working behind the scenes. It removes filler words like "uhm" and "ah," corrects grammar, adds automated highlights to key actions, and creates smooth zoom transitions. You're essentially getting a professional video editor and technical writer in one tool, without needing to know anything about video production or documentation.

Over 10,000 teams globally use Trupeer, from fast-growing startups to Fortune 500 companies. The platform is SOC2 and ISO27001 certified, meaning they take security seriously—important when you're recording potentially sensitive business content. With a G2 rating of 4.8 out of 5 stars, the user feedback speaks for itself.

The platform supports all major browsers including Chrome, Safari, Arc, Edge, and Comet. Whether you're creating product demos, training materials, customer success guides, or sales enablement content, Trupeer handles it all from a single recording.

### Important Pricing Notes

Credits are based on AI-generated video length, not recording time. If you record a 10-minute screen capture, you consume credits based on the final AI video output length, not the raw recording.

Video exports don't consume credits. You can export your created videos as many times as needed without using additional credits.

Guide creation is unlimited on all paid plans. Only AI video generation uses your monthly credit allocation.

Translation uses credits just like creating a new video. The length of the translated video determines credit usage, but exporting translated videos is free.

Unused credits don't roll over. Your AI video minutes reset monthly based on your plan.

You can cancel anytime by clicking the 'Cancel' button on the pricing page. You'll retain access to remaining credits for the current billing period.
